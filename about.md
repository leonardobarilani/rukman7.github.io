### Blog information

I'm taking notes for myself here. It's like talking to myself. This blog is basically me. So it's my inner me talking to this me through me.

### Author

Hi, My name is Rukmangathan. 'Rukman' in short. I work for a sucessful company as a software engineer. While I love to wear many hats, Most of my work is primarily focused around backend tech. I always wanted to gather my scattering thoughts or the random things I read or learn and save it somewhere. Maybe I'll write about those random things I learn/read here or maybe not. Excuse the brevity!
