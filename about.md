### Blog information

I'm taking notes for myself here. I also hope it will be useful for someone else.

### Author

Hi, My name is Rukmangathan. 'Rukman' in short. I work for a successful company as a software engineer. While I love to wear many hats, Most of my work is primarily focused around backend tech. I always wanted to gather my scattering thoughts or the random things I read or learn and save it somewhere. Maybe I'll write about those random things I learn/read here or maybe not. Excuse the brevity!

### Tech stack

This blog uses a customized version of the jekyll theme [hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) & it is hosted using [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).
