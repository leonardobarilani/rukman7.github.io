<p>Hi, My name is Rukmangathan. â€˜Rukmanâ€™ in short. I work for a sucessful company as a software engineer. While I love to wear many hats, Most of my work is primarily focused around backend tech. I always wanted to gather my scattering thoughts or the random things I read or learn and save it somewhere. Maybe Iâ€™ll write about those random things I learn/read here or maybe not. Excuse the brevity!</p>
