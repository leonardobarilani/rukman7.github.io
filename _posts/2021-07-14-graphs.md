## Graph

A graph is a data structure which stores data in the form of edges and vertices. Unlike arrays, Graphs are non-linear meaning that data is not arranged sequentially. So accessing a specific data in a graph cannot be done in a constant time. 

## Why do we need graphs?
Graphs can be used to represent a variety of real world problems/structures. Some of which are:
1. Connection between friends on a social media platform.
2. A computer network where vertices are networking machines and edges are connections between the machines.
3. A map of roles in an organization.
4. An electrical circuit.
5. Water pipeline network.

## Types of graphs
1. Weighted graph
   - Every edge in the graph is associated with a value referred as weight.
2. Unweighted graph.
   - No values are associated with edges.
3. Undirected graph
   - Connection between any two vertices are bi directional.
   - For an undirected graph G, if there exists a path from v1 to v2, then it is also true that that exists a path from v2 to v1.
4. Directed graph
   - Each edge is associated with a direction.

## Ways of representing graph programmatically

There are many ways to represent a graph data structure where two of the most commonly used being **adjacency matrix** and **adjacency list**. Each has its pros and cons.

**Adjacency matrix**: An NxN matrix where N is the number of vertices. If there exists an edge between two vertices say v1 and v2, then value at i,j will be 1 (where i points to v1 row and j points to v2 column).

```python
#adjacency matrix for the above graph
adjMatrix = [[0,1,0,0,0],
             [1,0,1,1,0],
             [0,1,0,1,1],
             [0,1,1,0,0],
             [0,0,1,0,0]]
```

**Adjacency list**: One of the cons of using adjacency matrix is that its size is always N^2 regardless of the number of edges. An adjacency list a way of storing list of neighbors for each vertex. It is usually implemented with hashtable based data structures. It usually requires less space than the matrix.

```python
#adjacency list for the above graph

adjList = {
            1: [2],
            2: [3,4],
            3: [2,4,5],
            4: [2,3],
            5: [3]
    }
```

## Traversing a graph

Graphs can be traversed using breadh first search and depth first search.

### Breath first search (BFS)

* Algorithm:
  * Explore the graph level by level.
  * First visit vertices one step away and then two steps away and so on...
  * Also keep track of already visited vertices.
* Time complexity: O(n^2) when using adjacency matrix and O(n+m) when using adjacency list where n is the vertices count & m is the number of edges.

```python
from collections import deque

# Assume  
# adjList - adjacency list representing a graph

def bfs(i): # BFS starting from vertex i
  visited = [0] * n #n is the number of vertices
  Q = deque()
  
  #start from i
  visited[i] = 1
  Q.append(i)

  #explore each vertex in the Q
  while len(Q) > 0:
    j = Q.pop()
    for k in adjList.get(j):
      if visited[k] == 0:
        visited[k] = 1
        Q.append(k)
```
* With BFS we can also do the following:
  * Trace back to the source from destination. This can be done by have a separate list which keeps track of parent or previous vertex when exploring a new vertex.
  * Trace the level at which a vertex is found from the source vertex. This can be done by having a list that keeps track of number of levels for every vertex that are being explored.
  * BFS can be used to find the shortest path if weight of all the edges are same.

### Depth first search(DFS)

* Algorithm
  * Start from a vertex i and visit any of its neighbor say j.
  * Suspend the exploring i and start exploring j instead.
  * Repeat it until we reach a vertex with no unexplored neighbors.
  * Backtrack to the nearest suspended vertex that still has an unexplored neighbor.
  * Use stack data structure to store the suspended vertices.
  * DFS can be naturally implemented using recursion and hence no external stack datastructure is needed when using recursion.

```python
# Assume  
# adjList - adjacency list representing a graph

visited = [0] * n #n is the number of vertices
parent = [-1] * n #to track parent of a vertex
def dfs(i):
  visited[i] = 1
  for j in adjList.get(i):
    if visited[j] == 0:
      parent[j] = i
      DFS(j)
```

* Time complexity: O(n^2) when using adjacency matrix and O(n+m) when using adjacency list where n is the vertices count & m is the number of edges. Similar to BFS.

* DFS uses:
  * Many useful information can be extracted from recording the order in which DFS visited vertices. This is called DFS numbering. Steps to implement DFS numbering is as follows. 
    * Maintain a counter and increment it each time when entering and leaving. 
    * When entering and leaving a vertex record the count.

```python
#DFS numbering
# Assume  
# adjList - adjacency list representing a graph

visited = [0] * n #n is the number of vertices
parent = [-1] * n #to track parent of a vertex
count = 0
pre = [0] * n
post = [0] * n

def dfs(i):
  visited[i] = 1
  pre[i] = count
  count += 1
  for j in adjList.get(i):
    if visited[j] == 0:   
      parent[j] = i
      DFS(j)
      post[j] = count
      count += 1
```

  * Pre and post can be used to 
    1. Find if a graph has a cycle.
    2. The cut vertex - removing this vertex would disconnect the graph.
