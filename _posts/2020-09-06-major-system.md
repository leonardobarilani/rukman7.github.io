### What is major system?
![sherlock holmes](../../../assets/images/sherlock-holmes.jpg)

* Major system is a method that can be used for remembering unusually long series of numbers. 

* The system is based on a simple principle that the human mind can remember images more easily than numbers. Generally numbers are difficuilt to remember for so many reasons like there are different possible combinations of them, They do not have visual or emotional value like the words. Words on the other hand will be usually based on a framework and unlike numbers not every combination would make sense.

* Basically each number is associated to a set of consonants. Split the series of numbers that is to be remembered into smaller chunks and form a word for each chunk based on the number to consonants mapping.

* Vowels and consonants y, h & w are not used in mapping. They can be used where ever possible to fill gap or make a word or a sentence meaningful.


### Mapping

Numeral | Associated letter(s) | Assist
------------ | ------------
0	| s, z, soft c |	z is the first letter of zero. The others have a similar sound.
1	| d, t, th |	d and t have one downstroke and sound similar (notice the tip of your tongue as you say them).
2	| n	| n has two downstrokes.
3	| m	| m has three downstrokes, also m looks like a 3 lying on its side.
4	| r	| the last letter of four, also 4 and R are almost mirror images of each other.
5	| l	| L is the Roman numeral for 50.
6	| j, sh, soft ch, dg, zh, soft g |	a script j has a lower loop like 6. These letters also have a ‘whistle-like’ sound, and 6 looks like a whistle.
7	| k, hard c, hard g, q, qu |	capital K contains two 7s (on their sides, back to back).
8	| v, f |	think of v as in a V8 motor. f sounds similar (notice how your teeth touch your lips for both).
9	| b, p	| p is a mirror-image 9. b sounds similar and resembles a 9 rolled around.
