### 1. Batman Begins

#### Sacrifice
We can learn from Bruce wayne that inorder to achieve something, We must be willing to sacrifice. Bruce tossed away his billionare life & trained hard all with an aim of fighting injustice in Gotham city. He did all these knowing that he won't be recognized for his good deeds/actions.

#### Will
willpower and discipline is more important than the training itself.

#### Favourite quotes from the movie
>_"It's not underneath who Iam its's what I do that defines me"_<br>
><cite>Bruce Wayne</cite>

>_"The training is nothing! The will is everything. The will to act"_<br>
><cite>Ra's al Ghul</cite>

### 2. The Prestige

#### Copying is copying
Angier copied Borden's 'The transported man illusion' trick and described it as though it was his own idea. This is similar to how people copy works of others and call it theirs. In the end, Copying is still copying.

#### Keeping a secret
Borden refused to share his secret no matter what. He had secret tricks in his sleeves which he would never reveal. Money, fame or nothing could persuade him away to reveal his secret trick. 

#### Favourite quotes from the movie
>_"If you give the secret up, you are nothing to them"_<br>
><cite>Alfred Borden</cite>

### 3. Ford v Ferrari

#### It is not about winning, it's about loving what you do
In the final race ken miles was 1 lap ahead of the racer in 2nd position. Ken Miles was instructed to slow down so that he can cross the finish line with his fellow members of Ford racing at the same time. But also one of the racer was ordered to gain speed while nearing the finish line which made Ken Miles a runner. Being cheated and not winning the 1st place did not sadden Ken Miles. Everyone knew he would have won the race easily. After the race, Ken miles said to Sheby(who tried to comfort him) that he was there for the driving and he got that as promised. He had no attachment to the position/prize whatsoever. He simply wanted to race which he loves doing.

#### Favourite quotes from the movie
>_"There are a precious few who find what they have to do"_<br>
